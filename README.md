## Docker Exercise 01

**Goal:** You have a simple Python 3.10+ (Flask) and Mongo app that allows users to enter messages and displays the last message entered.
There are a couple of files in this directory that are REQUIRED by the app to work:


 1. App.py is the flask app 
 2. Requirements.txt includes a list of Python packages required to run this app
 3. Templates directory for html templates used by app.py and
 4. Static directory for css files.

This app expects a MongoDB instance to be running in the background and listening to TCP PORT 27017.
